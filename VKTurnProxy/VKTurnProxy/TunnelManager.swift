            //     stack down at kernel level the moment startVPNTunnel runs
            //     and brings it back only after the tunnel reaches
            //     .connected. The WebView captcha flow needs network in the
            //     main app process — which it has now (status .disconnected,
            //     full physical interface) and won't have during .connecting.
            //
            //  2. The PoW + slider auto-solvers in Go work in 90%+ of cases.
            //     When they don't, we need a human in the loop, and that

    /// and throughput scales linearly (59.3 / 79.1 / 98.6 Mbit/s offered at

    /// The growth is not linear in N, and the flat step from 40 upward is not
    /// luck: Go's `sys` saturates at ~37 MB because GOMEMLIMIT is 35, so the
    /// runtime collects harder rather than growing. The structural per-conn
    /// cost is small — ~11.6 goroutines ≈ 48 KB of stack — while the visible
