// A standalone check for the app's dependency-free Swift invariants, compiled
// against the REAL source files rather than copies:
//
//   ./tools/swiftcheck/run.sh          (from the repository root)
//
// 🚨 THE COMMAND LIVES IN run.sh, NOT HERE. A compile line written into a comment
// goes stale the first time a section adds a source, and then the *documented* way
// to run the harness is broken while the harness itself is fine. One copy, and it
// is executable so it cannot drift silently.
//
// (the file is named main.swift because Swift allows top-level code in that one
// file only, and a multi-file compile rejects it anywhere else)
//
// 🚨 WHY IT IS NOT AN XCTest. The app has no test target, and adding one touches
// the scheme that `install.sh` and `release.sh` drive — not something to change in
// the middle of a measurement series. The types it asserts about depend on
// Foundation alone, so they compile standalone, and this file is the whole
// harness.
//
// WHAT IT GUARDS, and every one of these fails SILENTLY on a device:
//
//   • the two retirements of state that removed UIs left behind — each must fire,
//     must fire exactly ONCE (so the user's own later choice survives), must not
//     fire on a clean install, and must cover EVERY representation the diagnostic
//     builds wrote (the pacer had two: a Bool and a rate);
//   • the pacer's setting reads back as the one shipped rate, and OFF stays off;
//   • the two ENDS of the live-toggle message agree — a mismatch there is the
//     worst failure mode in the feature, because the toggle then does nothing on
//     a running tunnel and works perfectly after the next reconnect;
//   • the pacer's @AppStorage key is not observed by the navigation HOST, which
//     is how build 177 and issue #65 popped a pushed screen;
//   • EACH retirement is actually CALLED at launch, and ordered before the first
//     reader of its keys. Guarding the function and not its call site is the shape
//     that once bought a green suite and an empty log;
//   • the chunking machinery stays removed — it cannot coexist with a pacer that
//     reserves once per dequeue;
//   • the live-toggle bookkeeping: an intent is outstanding before it is sent, a
//     LATE acknowledgement cannot clear a newer one, silence is not success, and
//     the retry is bounded. The delivery itself needs a live
//     NETunnelProviderSession and cannot be tested — so everything decidable
//     without one was moved into a value type that can be.

//         the pin;
//       - a run that errored or was stopped set it too, though it produced

//
//     And a refused start faked a `progress` with state "error". The result
//     section renders only when `startedRun` is set, so on the FIRST attempt
//     that error appeared nowhere at all — the button did nothing — and once a
//     previous run existed it rendered inside THAT run's section.

//         and breaks a card nobody can refresh until the app next runs. This is
//         the same trap as compactClock and as the ServerProfile wipe.
//       - a routing change PUSHES the card. Nothing else does: a DIRECT flip
//         does not move the tunnel's status, which is what sync() is driven by,
//         so without this the card would claim traffic is tunnelled while it is
//         not.
//       - the intent is AWAITED in the handler. perform() ends and the app is
//         suspended; an un-awaited change would leave the card stale.
//       - THREE buttons, never four. The island's expanded .bottom region
